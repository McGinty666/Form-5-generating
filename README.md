To use the form 5 generator, first download XXXX_ Form5_workbook_template.xlsx to your C drive

Fill in the data relevant to your project and save it locally.

Then using Google Colab open the Form5_form_generator_colab_version.ipynb and press runtime > run all. (some packages will install) 

You are then asked to upload a file, upload your completed xlsx.

There is python code code in the Excel_to_Form_5_v1.py but this is only to be used when you are runnng a computer which won't have security systems blocking the installation of additional packages on your C drive.
